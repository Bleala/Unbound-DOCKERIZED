# Minimal Unbound configuration
# Forwarding to Cloudflare DoT

# For full config options, see: https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/manpages/unbound.conf.html

server:
  # Log verbosity level:
  # 0: No verbosity, only errors.
  # 1: Operational information. (Good default for general use)
  # 2: Detailed operational information.
  # 3: Query level information.
  # 4: Algorithm level information.
  # 5: Client identification for cache misses.
  verbosity: 2

  # Number of threads to create. 1 is usually fine for a simple forwarder.
  # For higher loads, match CPU cores or experiment.
  num-threads: 1

  # Network interfaces to listen on for incoming DNS queries.
  # 0.0.0.0 means listen on all available IPv4 interfaces.
  interface: 0.0.0.0
  # interface: ::0 # Listen on all available IPv6 interfaces

  # Port to answer queries on. Default is 53.
  port: 53

  # Protocol settings
  do-ip4: yes      # Enable IPv4 queries
  do-ip6: no       # Disable IPv6 queries
  do-udp: yes      # Enable UDP
  do-tcp: yes      # Enable TCP

  # Access control: specifies which clients are allowed to query.
  # 0.0.0.0/0 allows all IPv4 clients.
  # For a production environment, you might want to restrict this to specific subnets.
  access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 allow
  # access-control: ::0/0 allow # Only relevant if do-ip6 is yes

  # User to drop privileges to after binding ports.
  # This must match the user created in your Dockerfile.
  username: "unbound"

  # Unbound's working directory. Used for relative paths if chroot is enabled.
  # If chroot is disabled, this is where Unbound might look for some files by default.
  directory: "/etc/unbound"

  # Logging: send log messages to stdout so Docker can capture them.
  logfile: "/dev/stdout"
  use-syslog: no # Disable logging to syslog when using logfile directive.

  # PID file location.
  # Ensure the directory (/etc/unbound) is writable by the 'unbound' user
  # if Unbound manages the pidfile after dropping privileges.
  # (Typically, root creates it before dropping privileges).
  pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid"

  # Chroot: path to chroot the server to.
  # Empty string "" means no chroot, which simplifies path management in Docker.
  chroot: ""

  # DNSSEC settings:
  # Harden against DNSSEC stripping. Recommended to keep enabled.
  harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

  # File with the trusted root key for DNSSEC validation.
  # This file is typically created/updated by the `unbound-anchor` utility.
  # Your Dockerfile runs unbound-anchor to create this.
  auto-trust-anchor-file: "/etc/unbound/root.key"

  # Path to the CA certificate bundle for verifying the DoH/DoT server's TLS certificate.
  # This is the standard path for CA certificates in Alpine Linux.
  tls-cert-bundle: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"

  # Some generally useful defaults for performance and privacy:
  # Fetch DNSKEYs earlier in the validation process. Lowers latency.
  prefetch: yes
  prefetch-key: yes
  # Send minimum information to upstream servers to enhance privacy.
  qname-minimisation: yes
  # Reduce response size by not including authority/additional sections if not required.
  minimal-responses: yes

# Forward all queries (zone ".") to Cloudflare DNS over TLS (DoT).
forward-zone:
  name: "." # Specifies that all queries should be forwarded.
  forward-tls-upstream: yes # Crucial: tells Unbound these are DoT servers.

  # Cloudflare DoT server addresses:
  # The IP address is used for the initial TCP/TLS connection.
  # The hostname after '#' is used for the SNI in TLS and the HTTP Host header.
